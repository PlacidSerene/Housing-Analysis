## Analyzing Housing in Sacramento
This notebook looks into using various python-based analysis and data science libraries in an attempt to build a report to analyze housing and a simple recommendation system for housing in Sacramento

1. Problem definitions
Given housing attributes, what factors make a house expensive?

2. Data
The data comes from my attempt to scrape data from Trulia: https://www.trulia.com/CA/Sacramento/

Check the github page for more information about the scraping process

3. Evaluation
Given specific criteria, can we pick the top 10 houses available?

4. Features
This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data.

price: price of the house
address: where the house is located
bd&ba: number of bedroom and bathroom
sqft: how large the house is
